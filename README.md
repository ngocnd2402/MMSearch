# MMSearch - A Multi-Media System For Videos Retrieval From Visual Data
The MMSearch system composed by **several components**:

* **Semantic**-based Module
* **OCR**-based Module
* **ASR**-based Module
* **Object**-based Module
* **Sketch**-based Module
* **Pose**-based Module
* **Reranking** by User Feedback

We offer a web-based application for managing the MMSearch tool.

## Getting Started
First you need to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) 
### Requirements
To create required conda environment, run this command:

```bash
pip install -r env/server.txt
```
### Preprocessing your data
If you possess your own dataset containing videos, please preprocess the data according to our guidelines:
```bash
cd preprocessing
```
```bash
python cut_frame.py
```
Once completed, your video data will be efficiently divided into frames.
